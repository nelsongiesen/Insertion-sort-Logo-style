# Insertion-sort-Logo-style

A funny toy beginners can learn to build

A lot of people love Insertion Sort - because it's funny. Seymour Papert and Brian Harvey wrote fun books about the Logo dialect of List Processing. The Logo dialect uses language in a similar way to natural English. The selector first-item chooses the first item of a list. The selector without-first-item returns the list without the first item. The constrctor add-to-end adds an item to the end of a list. The constructor combine-lists combines two lists into one list. The constructor listify takes any number of items and turns them into a list. The question empty? asks if a list is empty. The question less-than? asks if a number is less than another number. The question more-than? asks if a number is more than another number. The word empty-list represents the empty list.

Our programs use four magic words:
Define creates programs and allows us to name them.
Lambda creates inputs and allows us to name them.
Let creates local variables and allows us to name them.
Letrec creates helper programs and allows us to name them.
