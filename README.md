# Insertion-sort-Logo-style

A funny toy beginners can learn to build

A lot of people love Insertion Sort - because it's funny. Seymour Papert and Brian Harvey wrote fun books about the Logo dialect of List Processing. The Logo dialect uses language in a similar way to natural English. The selector first-item chooses the first item of a list. The selector without-first-item returns the list without the first item. The constrctor add-to-end adds an item to the end of a list. The constructor combine-lists combines two lists into one list. The constructor listify takes any number of items and turns them into a list. The question empty? asks if a list is empty. The question less-than? asks if a number is less than another number. The question more-than? asks if a number is more than another number. The word empty-list represents the empty list.
