; How to use the sorter:
; We use parentheses to run programs.
; But the sorter takes a list as its input.
; So we run the sorter like this: (insertion-sort (listify 3 2 1 6 5 4 9 8 7))
; The inside parentheses create a list.
; And the outside parentheses run the insertion-sort program on the list.
; If you type that into any Scheme-dialect repl (the same type of instant interpretter that Python uses) it will return a sorted list.
; You can have much fun testing and tinkering with it.

               ; Insert is a program that takes an item and a sorted list. It puts the item into the list where it fits.
               ; We use a helper program with two lists:
               ; A list that tracks the part-before the item.
               ; And a list that tracks the part-after the item.
               ; If the item is less than the first item of the part-after, then it is in the right spot.
               ; We just put the lists back together with the item in the middle and we are done.
               ; Otherwise, we move the first item of part-after to the end of part-before and try again.
               ; The other way we will know we are done is if the part-after is empty. That means everything was less than the item.
               ; We just add the item to the end of the part-before and we are done.
(define insert ; We use define to create a program, in this case we name it insert.
  (lambda (item sorted-ls) ; We use lambda to name our inputs: in this case we have two named item and orig-ls.
